# BasketBall Game üèÄ

This is a Java program that implements the [Observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern), which is a behavioral design pattern. It specifies communication between objects(observable) and observers.

## What does the application do?

The implementation is a program that includes a class "Scoring" that keeps track of a basketball game scores and the subscribers (observers) that are subscribed to that scoring class. The Subject class updates the score of a game 4 times (every quarter). The user indicates when the quarter ends through console input.

You initially have 3 subscriber Objects which need to know the updated score after every quarter. The observers (subscribers) are:

- An object that aims to predict final game score.
- An object that is keeping track of all scores.
- An object that generates a news piece title based on the game result.

The program offers a menu to:

- Start a new game (picks 2 random teams and instantiates the Scoring class).
- Simulate 1 quarter ( the scoring class updates scores then notifies subscribers)
- Print the current scores for each quarter.
- Print the current prediction for the final game.
- Print a table of scores of all finished games.
- Generate a news piece title based on result of the last finished game. Example: (("TeamA-name" beat "TeamB-name" by 23 points in a landslide/tightly contested game)).
